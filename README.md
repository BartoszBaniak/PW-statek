# Project for the subject of Concurrent Programming
A vessel of capacity N is standing at the quay. The ship is connected to the land by a bridge of capacity K (K<N). There are passengers trying to board the ship, except that no more than N can board the ship, and when boarding the ship there can be no more than K on the bridge at the same time. The ship sets sail every one hour. At the time of departure, the ship's captain must ensure that there are no entering passengers on the bridge. At the same time, he must ensure that the number of passengers on board does not exceed N.
